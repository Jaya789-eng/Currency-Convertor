## 📝 Notes

* This application uses a public currency exchange API (like [Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app) or [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)) to fetch real-time currency data.
* Make sure you have a stable internet connection to retrieve updated rates.
* If using a paid or key-based API, ensure your API key is securely stored and not exposed publicly in the `script.js` file (consider using environment variables or backend proxy in advanced versions).
* The UI is kept minimal for better focus on core functionality and easy customization.
